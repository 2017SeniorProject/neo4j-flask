# Run the Application

First and foremost, make sure you have [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/) up and running at [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) (the default port when starting Neo4j).

To run the application, assuming your `run.py` file looks as I described it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/project-structure.html), simply execute `run.py`:

```
python run.py
```

Your application will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
